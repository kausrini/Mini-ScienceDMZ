# A Mini-ScienceDMZ For Scientific Instruments

## Introduction

The project designs, develops, and tests the deployment of a small device that functions as a firewall, large file transfer facility, and network performance monitor. The device consists of a small, low-power box positioned between the instrument and the campus network. Firewall policies are configurable by the researcher (or their designate) via a cloud-based portal. The file transfer facility will transfer large data files over long distances, while maintaining reliable performance. This facility will also digitally sign files, so data integrity can be verified throughout the science workflow. In turn, the network performance monitor will interface with associated online systems, so performance bottlenecks can be easily identified. Ultimately, this architecture and implementation will ensure optimal data processing while safeguarding the integrity of the instrument and its data throughout the scientific workflow.

## Installation

### Raspberry Pi Setup For Mini-ScienceDMZ

1. Follow the instructions on the official raspberry pi page to install Raspbian on a SD card.
   - We recommend the advanced setup option. Download the **Stretch-Lite** image and flash it using _Etcher_ tool.
   - Click [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) for the official instructions.

2. Download the raspberry setup files from [here](/pi_setup_files)

3. Once step 1 is complete the sd card would be partitioned into two parts. One of those partitions would be named as **boot**. Place the files from step 2 in this boot partition of the SD card.

4. Create an account in [Dynv6](https://dynv6.com/) and register a **DOMAIN_NAME** (i.e create a new host).
   - This account will allow you to create a DNS record which can be used for [Dynamic DNS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136) purposes

5. Go to [Dynv6 APIs](https://dynv6.com/docs/apis) and obtain *Your API token* which is the **token** parameter in the HTTP Update API section. 

6. Edit the **dynv6_token.txt** file in the boot directory and replace _TOKEN_WILL_REPLACE_THIS_ with *Your API token*. 

7. Edit the **pi_settings.py** and store the **DOMAIN_NAME** you registered in step 4 in the variable **DOMAIN_NAME**.

8. Insert the sd card in the pi and connect power cable, HDMI, Keyboard to it.

9. Connect the pi to the RDP enabled equipment using a lan cable.
 > - NOTE :  This **MUST** be done by connecting the pi to the default ethernet/lan port in the raspberry pi. It will be the eth0 interface. Do **NOT** connect the RDP enabled equipment to a usb port using a LAN cable + USB Ethernet adapter combination. This connection will be assigned eth1+ interface and would interfere with our configuration scripts.

10. Login to the raspberry pi with default credentials. (Username : pi, Password : raspberry)

11. Modify the file permissions and launch the initial setup script as follows. 
    ```
    sudo chmod 700 /boot/*.py
    sudo /boot/pi_initial_setup.py
    ```
    - Follow the prompts to finish the initial configuration of raspberry pi. The pi will reboot after this configuration completes.
     - Answer the prompt if the pi will be using a wireless internet connection. 
       If answered with yes, you will be prompted to answer if the wifi network is WPA-Enterprise.
       If answered with yes, you will be prompted for username. Provide the username.
       Enter the wifi password when you are prompted for it.
       Change the default raspberry pi password to a **NEW_PASSWORD** when prompted for it.
     - If wired internet connection, user must use an use ethernet usb adapter to connect via the raspberry pi's usb port.
     - Note this script has two optional arguments that user can use to modify the automated configuration of dynamic dns and dynamic ip configuration. Use `sudo /boot/pi_initial_setup.py -h` further information.

12. Log into the raspberry pi with the username **pi** and the **NEW_PASSWORD**.

13. Ensure that Remote Desktop Protocol is enabled in the scientific instrument being connected to the raspberry pi.

14. By default the script configures CAS authentication module. For this, edit pi_settings.py file and change the CAS_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT to your CAS server URL. If you wish to use a SAML authentication module, please edit the saml_config.json file appropriately and run pi_final_setup.py with '-a' switch. Use `sudo /boot/pi_final_setup.py -h` further information. 

15. Launch the final setup script using the following command and wait for the raspberry pi to reboot.
    ```
    sudo /boot/pi_final_setup.py -e YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
    ```
    - This script will by default try to use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/about/) to configure HTTPS using a production grade certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/about/) certificate authority. If that fails, it falls back to a self-signed certificate generation to ensure an HTTPS connection between user and our minidmz setup. 
    - The script can obtain [test certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/) from Let's Encrypt by issuing the following command. `sudo /boot/pi_final_setup.py -t -e YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS`
    - We can force the script to use self-signed certificates or use HTTP configuration (**Not Recommended**) by using appropriate arguments. Use `sudo /boot/pi_final_setup.py -h` further information.
    - The script can also install perfsonar by using the switch '-p'. Use `sudo /boot/pi_final_setup.py -h` further information. 
>  - Note: Letâ€™s Encrypt CA issues short-lived certificates (90 days).The *YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS* is used by the CA to warn you if the certificate is about to expire or for revocation purposes. If email address used for self-signed certificate, its used in the certificate generation process. 
 

### Guacamole Setup For Mini-ScienceDMZ

1. Login to pi with username pi and the password set by you (**NEW_PASSWORD**).

2. Edit the file **/home/pi/minidmz/guacamole_setup_files/settings.py** and change the DOMAIN_NAME to the one obtained in step 4 of **Raspberry Pi Setup for Mini-ScienceDMZ**.

3. Enter the following command to launch the Gucamole setup. 
   ```
   /home/pi/minidmz/guacamole_setup_files/setup.py -u USERNAME
   ```
   - Replace the USERNAME with the username used to authenticate with CAS server. This username (user) will be the administrator for the application. The administrator would be able to add other users to the application granting them access to the scientific device.
   - Users added by the administrator persists even when the *setup.py* is launched multiple times. To completely delete all the user information and create a fresh instance, use the following command. `/home/pi/minidmz/guacamole_setup_files/setup.py -f -u USERNAME`

4. The Guacamole page can be visited at https://DOMAIN_NAME/guacamole/ if configured with HTTPS and at http://DOMAIN_NAME/guacamole/ if configured as HTTP.

### Log Emails For Mini-ScienceDMZ

1. Edit **/home/pi/minidmz/log_email/email_config.json** file to configure email parameters.

2. The username and password fields are required for authentication with the mail server. smtp_server_name field is the mail server. The user can specify multiple receiver email ids by comma seperated values as it is a json array. 

3. During the pi setup log_email will be added to the crontab with a frequency of every 6 hours.

Note that this module currently sends only the guacamole logs and syslog. It sends only the difference in logs since the last email. 


## Important Points of Consideration

HTTP configuration is discouraged as the password for connecting to the remote desktop machine (scientific instrument) will travel un-encrypted from the user browser to the raspberry pi. 

Please secure the SSH server on the Raspberry Pi. Disable Password logins and move to SSH-Keys. Check [official debian documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/SSH#Good_practices_with_SSH_Server) for futher information.

A WPA-Enterprise wifi network requires an username and password for connection. Examples are corporate networks or university networks.
A WPA-Personal wifi network requires only password for connection. Examples are home wifi networks.

The script tries to configure wireless/wired connection using standard configurations. If the wireless is not configured, manual configuration may be required. Check wpa_supplicant.conf and interfaces files for modifications.
